I was testing data save/load into a JSON file in a project then found re-opening the file to check changes too tedious, so I created this simple .NET 8 app.
This will automatically detect any change in the folder where the selected file is, then re-read the selected file.
Can read JSON and TXT files.

Download:  
&nbsp; the source code and compile it to suit your needs.  
&nbsp; or  
&nbsp; the JsonWatcher.zip file in the release section for a self-contained Windows x64 compiled version.
